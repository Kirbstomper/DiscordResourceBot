# PhantasyStarResourceDiscordBot
A Discord Bot written in golang designed to easily give users a list of resources they request

Because this is a template repo, you can simply click the "Use this template" button, edit the YAML file and add it to your own server. Very quick and easy.

I created this mainly for my PSO2 Alliance, but the `resources.yml` file can be edited to fit whatever you need it to! 

# Usage 
- get dependencies
- run `go build` 
- run `./DiscordResourceBot -t BOT_TOKEN _NUMBER`

# Libraries
- DiscordGo (github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
- yaml (gopkg.in/yaml.v2)
